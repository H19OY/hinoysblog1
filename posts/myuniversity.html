<p>The University I went to is Military Institute of Science and Technology!</p>
<p>MIST came into existence on 19 April 1998 and academic programs were launched in January 1999.
 The initial batches included only selected military students. Feeling the necessity of spreading quality engineering education, the authority decided to admit civil students (both male and female) and from 2002, civilian students started to admit in different departments through passing a rigorous 'Admission Test'.
 The maiden department of the institute is Civil Engineering department which started functioning from 1999. 
 After that in 2000, Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) department established. 
 Mechanical Engineering (ME) department and Electrical, Electronic & Communication Engineering (EECE) department were established on year 2003. MIST started its Masters program in different discipline from 2012 and MPhil/PhD from year 2014
