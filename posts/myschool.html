<p>The school I went to is Government Science College Attached High School!</a></p>
<p>In 1954, the then East Pakistan Government established experimentally only 4 Technical High School in Pakistan. 
Govt. Technical High School Tejgaon, Dhaka was one of them. 
On that time each and every responsibility was taken by the headmaster.
 In 1962, that school was turned into an intermediate college and the rank of headmaster was upgraded to principal. 
 For that reason, the then headmaster Mr. Abdur Razzak was formed headmaster for 18 years. 
 In 1991, the Government of Bangladesh started double shift in 62 secondary schools.
 And Government Science College Attached High School was one of them.
 From 2001, the headmasters took all the administrative responsibility.
